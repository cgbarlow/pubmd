# Focused Problem Statement: Mermaid PDF Export - Text Invisible Despite Manual SVG Attribute Inlining (Solution A)

## Problem Statement
In a client-side Markdown-to-PDF export system, Mermaid diagram text remains invisible in the PDF output. This occurs despite implementing "Solution A" – a manual process of inlining SVG presentation attributes onto a cloned diagram. While this method successfully styles non-text elements (node shapes, edges, arrows), all attempts to make node text visible by similarly inlining attributes (`fill`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `text-anchor`, etc.) onto `<text>` and `<tspan>` elements have failed. The HTML preview consistently displays the diagram and text correctly.

## Background
The proof-of-concept aims for a fully client-side Markdown-to-PDF workflow using `markdown-it`, `mermaid` (v11, 'base' theme), `html-to-pdfmake`, and `pdfMake`. Initially, all Mermaid styling was lost in PDF exports. Research indicated `pdfMake`/`svg-to-pdfkit`'s reliance on inline SVG presentation attributes. "Solution A" was developed, involving:
1.  Rendering the Mermaid diagram to SVG in the browser.
2.  Cloning the preview content containing the SVG.
3.  Within this clone, programmatically removing `<style>` tags from the SVG.
4.  Programmatically setting explicit presentation attributes on SVG elements.
5.  Passing the `innerHTML` of this modified clone to `htmlToPdfmake`.

This approach successfully styled node shapes and lines but not the text within nodes.

## Attempted Fixes under Solution A (`manualInlineSvgStyles`)
All attempts focused on manipulating attributes of `<text>` and `<tspan>` elements within the cloned SVG:

1.  **Basic Styling:**
    *   Set `fill` attribute to `#000000` (black).
    *   Set `stroke` attribute to `none`.
2.  **Font Family:**
    *   Attempted to copy computed `font-family` from the live preview.
    *   Hardcoded `font-family` to `"Roboto"` (a standard font available to `pdfMake`).
3.  **Font Size:**
    *   Attempted to copy computed `font-size` from the live preview.
    *   Hardcoded `font-size` to `"10"` (a common numeric value expected by `pdfMake`).
4.  **Text Anchor:**
    *   Attempted to copy computed `text-anchor` from the live preview.
    *   Hardcoded `text-anchor` to `"middle"`.
5.  **Other Font Attributes:**
    *   Explicitly removed `font-weight` and `font-style` attributes to avoid potential conflicts.
6.  **Combination:** Applied various combinations of the above, ensuring `fill`, `font-family`, and `font-size` were always present with valid values.

## Observations
*   **Successful Styling (Non-Text Elements):**
    *   Node shapes (e.g., `rect`, `polygon`) correctly display with applied `fill` (e.g., `#FFFFE0` - light yellow) and `stroke` (e.g., `#808080` - gray) in the PDF.
    *   Edge paths and arrowheads correctly display with applied `stroke` (e.g., `#000000` - black) and `fill` (for arrowheads) in the PDF.
*   **Persistent Failure (Text Elements):**
    *   Despite all attribute manipulations listed above, text within nodes remains completely invisible in the generated PDF.
*   **Live Preview Consistency:** The HTML preview of the Mermaid diagram (both original and the in-memory clone before `htmlToPdfmake` processing) always shows text correctly styled and visible.
*   **SVG Structure:** Console inspection confirms Mermaid's 'base' theme generates standard SVG `<text>` and `<tspan>` elements for node labels.

## Hypothesis
The consistent failure to render text, even with explicit and valid SVG presentation attributes (including `pdfMake`-compatible fonts and sizes), suggests the problem is not a simple omission of styling attributes on the text elements. The issue likely lies in how these specifically-processed SVG `<text>` or `<tspan>` elements are interpreted or converted by either:
1.  **`htmlToPdfmake`:** It might be failing to correctly translate these SVG text constructs into the `pdfMake` document definition, potentially dropping them, creating malformed text objects, or losing critical positional/rendering information.
2.  **`pdfMake`/`svg-to-pdfkit`:** The underlying SVG rendering engine might have a limitation or bug in handling SVG text elements when they are part of a larger SVG structure processed this way, leading to them being rendered with zero opacity, zero effective size, clipped, or incorrectly positioned outside the visible area.

The fact that other SVG elements are styled correctly via the same attribute inlining mechanism points to a problem specific to text element processing in the SVG-to-PDF pipeline.
