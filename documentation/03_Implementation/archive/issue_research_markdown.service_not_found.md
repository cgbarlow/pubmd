Your build is failing because TypeScript can’t locate **markdown.types.ts** (and everything that depends on it), so every import chain that references that file collapses. Once the compiler hits that brick wall it also reports that it can’t “find” `markdown.service` (even though the file is there) because it never managed to type–check it. Below is a quick-fix checklist followed by deeper diagnostics and a few build-script clean-ups to keep the problem from coming back.

## 1  Why you’re seeing TS2307

| Symptom                                                                              | Under-the-hood cause                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Cannot find module './markdown.types'` inside **markdown.service.ts**               | The file is missing or mis-named, so the compiler can’t resolve it.                                                                         |
| The same error bubbles up for `./services/markdown/markdown.service` in **index.ts** | When a module fails to compile, every place that re-exports it also reports “cannot find module”.                                           |
| Works on macOS but not in your Linux-based Codespace                                 | Linux file systems are case-sensitive; a capital-letter mismatch in the path will break resolution.                                         |
| Occurs only in the **build** script, not in VS Code intellisense                     | The build script uses a different `tsconfig` (see § 3) so a file that *looks* included in the IDE may in fact be excluded at compile time.  |

## 2  Quick-fix checklist (do these first)

1. **Add or rename the file**
   Create `src/services/markdown/markdown.types.ts` (or rename the existing file so the path matches the import exactly, including case).

   ```ts
   // src/services/markdown/markdown.types.ts
   export interface IMarkdownService {
     parse(markdown: string, opts?: MarkdownParseOptions): Promise<string>;
   }
   export interface MarkdownParseOptions {
     mermaidSecurityLevel?: 'loose' | 'strict';
   }
   export type MermaidTheme = 'default' | 'dark';
   export type MermaidSecurityLevel = 'loose' | 'strict';
   ```

2. **Re-run the build**

   ```bash
   npx tsc -p tsconfig.build.json          # CommonJS build
   npx tsc -p tsconfig.esm.json --noEmit   # (see § 3 about this filename)
   ```

3. **Check for case mismatches** if the error persists. A fast way is:

   ```bash
   npx tsc --traceResolution | grep markdown.types
   ```

   The trace will show the exact pathname the compiler looked for.&#x20;

4. **Commit the file** so CI and your colleagues get it too.

With the types file in place the original errors disappear for almost every project immediately.&#x20;

## 3  Clean-ups in your `package.json` scripts

| Issue                                                                                           | Fix                                                                                                                   | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The build script calls `tsc -p tsconfig.esm.json`, but the repo only contains **test-esm.json** | Rename the file to `tsconfig.esm.json` *or* change the script                                                         | Otherwise the second build step runs with the *default* `tsconfig`, and any mismatch in `rootDir`, `include`, or `exclude` will recreate “cannot find module” errors. ([github.com][1]) |
| You’re emitting both CJS and ESM bundles manually                                               | Consider a dual-config approach (`./tsconfig.cjs.json` + `./tsconfig.esm.json`) or use a helper such as **tsc-multi** | This keeps source-maps and declaration files in sync and avoids double work. ([thesametech.com][2], [github.com][3])                                                                    |
| IDE shows modules that the build cannot see                                                     | Give each environment its own `tsconfig` and link them with `references`                                              | Recommended by the TypeScript handbook for multi-target libs. ([typescriptlang.org][4])                                                                                                 |

## 4  Deeper diagnostics (only if errors persist)

1. **Verify `include`/`exclude`**
   Your `tsconfig.build.json` excludes `dist` (good) but inherits `"rootDir": "."` from the root config. Make sure it is overridden by `"rootDir": "./src"` (you already do this — keep it).&#x20;

2. **Watch out for “implicit any”**
   Sometimes VS Code hides these underlines, but the CLI fails the build and then reports a missing module instead of a type error. Running `npx tsc --pretty` makes them obvious.&#x20;

3. **ESM quirks**
   Because your package is `"type": "module"`, local *runtime* imports in compiled JS will require a `.js` extension (`import './markdown.service.js'`). The TypeScript compiler handles that for you as long as you keep separate `outDir`s. ([dev.to][5])

---

## 5  Recap

* **Add `markdown.types.ts`** → resolves the root error.
* **Line up filenames** (`tsconfig.esm.json` ↔ script) so your CJS/ESM builds see the same source tree.
* **Use `--traceResolution`** the next time you want to know exactly where TypeScript is looking.

Once those are in place, `npm run build` and `npm run test:markdown` should both complete without TS2307. Happy compiling!
