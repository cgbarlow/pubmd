# Analysis 1: Gemini 2.5 Pro:
Okay, I can help you troubleshoot this "Could not find a suitable point for the given distance" error with Mermaid.js. This error typically indicates an issue with rendering SVG paths or text, often related to font metrics, CSS conflicts, or the SVG rendering context itself.

Based on your detailed information, here's an analysis and some concrete suggestions:

**Primary Hypothesis: Font Metrics and Mermaid Configuration**

Your hypothesis that font metrics or CSS conflicts are at play is highly likely. Mermaid needs to accurately measure text to draw diagrams correctly. Even if fonts are loaded via `@font-face`, Mermaid might not pick them up automatically for its internal calculations unless explicitly told.

**Recommended Action:**

1.  **Explicitly Set `fontFamily` in Mermaid Initialization:**
    You are already loading 'DejaVu Sans' and 'DejaVu Serif'. Ensure Mermaid uses these fonts. You should modify your `mermaid.initialize` calls to include the `fontFamily` option.

    In your `script.js`, update the `mermaid.initialize` calls:

    *   **In `DOMContentLoaded`:**
        ```javascript
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
            // ...
            const initialSerifFont = getPreference('fontPreference') === 'serif';
            const initialMermaidFontFamily = initialSerifFont ? "DejaVu Serif" : "DejaVu Sans"; // Use the exact font name

            try {
                mermaid.initialize({
                    startOnLoad: false,
                    theme: 'default', // This will be updated by updateUIStates if needed
                    securityLevel: 'loose',
                    fontFamily: initialMermaidFontFamily // Add this line
                });
                console.log('Mermaid.js initialized for client-side preview with font:', initialMermaidFontFamily);
            } catch (e) {
                console.error("Failed to initialize Mermaid.js:", e);
            }
            // ...
        });
        ```

    *   **In `updateUIStates` function:**
        This function is correctly re-initializing Mermaid when the theme changes (due to dark mode). You should also ensure the font family is correctly set here according to the user's font preference.
        ```javascript
        const updateUIStates = (isDarkModeActive, isSerifFontActive) => {
            const mermaidTheme = isDarkModeActive ? 'dark' : 'default';
            const mermaidFontFamily = isSerifFontActive ? "DejaVu Serif" : "DejaVu Sans"; // Use the exact font name

            if (typeof mermaid?.initialize === 'function') {
                 mermaid.initialize({
                    startOnLoad: false,
                    theme: mermaidTheme,
                    securityLevel: 'loose',
                    fontFamily: mermaidFontFamily // Add or ensure this line is correct
                 });
                 console.log('Mermaid re-initialized with theme:', mermaidTheme, 'and font:', mermaidFontFamily);
            }
            // ... (rest of your function)
        };
        ```        **Note:** Ensure the font names `"DejaVu Sans"` and `"DejaVu Serif"` exactly match the names used in your `@font-face` declarations within `initializeFontsForPreview`.

**Further Troubleshooting Steps if the Above Doesn't Resolve the Issue:**

2.  **CSS Conflicts:**
    *   **Isolate Styling:** Temporarily create a very minimal test page that only includes a Mermaid diagram, the necessary Mermaid script, and your font loading logic. Avoid including your main `style.css` or modal-specific CSS. If the diagram renders here, it points to a CSS conflict in your application.
    *   **Inspect SVG Elements:** When the error occurs, use your browser's developer tools to inspect the (partially) rendered SVG elements within the `.mermaid` div. Look for any unusual CSS properties being inherited by `<text>`, `<tspan>`, or `<path>` elements that might interfere with their positioning or sizing (e.g., `display`, `line-height`, `transform`).
    *   **`box-sizing`:** While generally not an issue, if you have a global `* { box-sizing: border-box; }`, ensure it's not unexpectedly affecting SVG internal element sizing. This is a less common cause for this specific error.
    *   **Preview Modal CSS:** The styles for `#previewModalContent` include `font-size: 12pt;`. While Mermaid themes usually define their own font sizes, this base size on the container could have subtle influences. Try removing or changing this temporarily.

3.  **Timing of `mermaid.run()`:**
    *   Although you call `mermaid.run()` after populating `innerHTML` and (presumably) making the modal visible, there could still be a race condition where the browser hasn't fully calculated dimensions. As a quick test, try delaying the `mermaid.run()` call slightly:
        ```javascript
        // Inside prepareContentForPreviewAndPdf, before mermaid.run()
        // ...
        previewModalContent.innerHTML = htmlContentToPreview;
        // Make modal visible
        previewModalOverlay.style.display = 'flex'; // Ensure it's visible BEFORE run

        // Then run Mermaid
        try {
            if (typeof mermaid?.run === 'function') {
                const mermaidElements = previewModalContent.querySelectorAll('.mermaid');
                console.log(`[Preview] Found ${mermaidElements.length} elements with class 'mermaid' for Mermaid.run().`);
                if (mermaidElements.length > 0) {
                    // ---- START TEST ----
                    // setTimeout(async () => { // Optional: test with a small delay
                        await mermaid.run({ nodes: mermaidElements });
                        console.log("[Preview] Client-side Mermaid.run() executed.");
                    // }, 100);
                    // ---- END TEST ----
                }
            } // ...
        } // ...
        ```

4.  **Simplify the Diagram Further (If Not Already Minimal):**
    While `graph TD; A-->B;` is simple, ensure there are no non-standard characters or invisible characters around it in your `default.md` or test input.

5.  **Check Mermaid Version for Known Issues:**
    You are using Mermaid v11.6.0. It might be worth searching for issues related to this error message and this specific version or recent versions.
    The search results confirm that the error "Could not find a suitable point for the given distance" is indeed an internal Mermaid error related to diagram generation, specifically when calculating positions for elements like text or cardinality markers on relationships. One result even shows this exact error message in Mermaid's own utility TypeScript code.

While the search results don't point to a single definitive cause tied to a specific Mermaid version or a widespread bug with v11.6.0, they highlight common themes around Mermaid rendering:
*   **Client-Side Rendering**: Mermaid operates by rendering SVG on the client-side.
*   **SVG Text Rendering**: Issues with text in SVGs generated by Mermaid have been noted in various contexts, sometimes related to how SVG `<foreignObject>` is used or how different viewers/environments handle SVG text.
*   **Environment and Dependencies**: Mermaid aims to have no external dependencies for its core rendering, but its interaction with the browser's DOM, CSS, and font rendering capabilities is crucial.

The error has also been observed in other contexts where Mermaid is embedded, such as GitHub's Markdown rendering.

Given this, the initial advice to **explicitly set `fontFamily` in `mermaid.initialize`** remains the most critical first step, as it directly addresses how Mermaid perceives font metrics.

**Final Recommendations:**

1.  **Implement Explicit `fontFamily` in `mermaid.initialize`:** This is the highest priority. Make sure the font names like `"DejaVu Sans"` and `"DejaVu Serif"` in the JavaScript `mermaid.initialize` call precisely match the names defined in your `@font-face` CSS rules.

2.  **Verify Font Loading and Application:** Double-check in your browser's developer tools (Network tab) that the DejaVu font files are successfully downloaded. Inspect the `#previewModalContent` and a `.mermaid` div within it to confirm that the `font-family` CSS property is correctly applied as expected ('DejaVu Sans' or 'DejaVu Serif').

3.  **Consider Mermaid Theming and Fonts:** Mermaid themes can have their own default font stacks. Explicitly setting `fontFamily` in the `mermaid.initialize` config is intended to override this. If problems persist, you could try a very basic theme like `neutral` or `base` (if available, often `base` or `default` are good starting points) along with your explicit `fontFamily` to minimize theme-specific CSS interference.

4.  **CSS Isolation:**
    *   Temporarily add a more specific CSS rule to ensure no unexpected `line-height` or `font-size` is affecting Mermaid's internal calculations for its specific elements:
        ```css
        #previewModalContent .mermaid,
        #previewModalContent .mermaid svg {
            font-size: initial; /* Or a specific known-good size like 10px if 'initial' is problematic */
            line-height: normal; /* Or 1.2 */
        }
        ```
        This is a diagnostic step; if it works, you'll need to find a less disruptive way to ensure Mermaid's container doesn't inherit problematic styles.

5.  **Order of Operations:**
    *   Ensure the `previewModalOverlay` is `display: flex;` (i.e., visible) *before* `mermaid.run()` is called. Elements that are `display: none` (or inside such parents) often report incorrect dimensions, which can break layout-dependent JavaScript libraries. Your current code seems to do this, but it's worth double-checking if any other logic might hide it temporarily.

6.  **Test with a Standard Font:** As a temporary diagnostic step, try configuring Mermaid to use a very common, universally available web-safe font (e.g., `fontFamily: 'Arial'` or `fontFamily: 'Verdana'`) *without* relying on your base64 encoded `@font-face` fonts. If this works, it points more strongly to an issue with how the custom DejaVu fonts are being loaded, interpreted by the browser for SVG, or by Mermaid.

If after these steps the problem still persists, you might need to create a minimal reproducible example (a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JS) that demonstrates the error. This can help isolate whether the issue is with Mermaid.js itself, your specific font loading technique, or a subtle interaction with other parts of your application's environment.

# Analysis 2: ChatGPT o3:

**Quick answer (TL;DR)** – the error is *not* caused by your Markdown, fonts, or DOMPurify. Mermaid is exploding because you ask it to lay-out the diagram **while the preview modal is still `display:none`**. In that state every node reports zero width/height, Dagre’s intersection maths divides by 0 and throws *“Could not find a suitable point for the given distance”* – exactly the bug reported by others when diagrams are rendered inside hidden containers or nodes are styled `display:none` ([GitHub][1], [GitHub][2], [GitHub][2]).
Make the container visible *first*, or keep it in the normal flow (e.g. `visibility:hidden; position:absolute; left:-9999px`) until after `mermaid.run()` has completed, and the error disappears.

---

## 1  Why the crash happens

Mermaid delegates layout to Dagre. During edge-routing Dagre tries to find an intersection point between two bounding boxes; if either box has width = 0 or height = 0, a divide-by-zero path calculation fails and the library throws the very message you see ([GitHub][3], [GitHub][3]).
GitHub issues and Stack Overflow threads all show the same pattern: the failing nodes were hidden (class `hidden { display:none }`) or rendered inside a tab/modal that hadn’t been shown yet ([GitHub][4], [GitHub][2]).

In your app `prepareContentForPreviewAndPdf()` builds the HTML, **calls `mermaid.run()`**, *then* flips `#previewModalOverlay` from `display:none` to `display:flex` – so Mermaid is always working on a zero-sized layout.

---

## 2  Two practical fixes

### 2.1 Show first, render second

The simplest patch is to reveal the modal, wait one paint frame, and then run Mermaid:

```javascript
// make overlay visible *before* rendering
previewModalOverlay.style.display = 'flex';

/* wait until the browser has done a layout pass
   so nodes have non-zero sizes.
   Using rAF avoids an arbitrary setTimeout. */
await new Promise(requestAnimationFrame);

await mermaid.run({ nodes: previewModalContent.querySelectorAll('.mermaid') });
```

Because the call happens after the first `requestAnimationFrame`, every `.mermaid` div now has real dimensions and Dagre succeeds.

### 2.2 Keep the container in the render-tree

If you want to hide the modal without triggering layout thrash, give it off-screen coordinates instead of `display:none`:

```css
#previewModalOverlay { 
  position:fixed; left:-9999px; top:0; /* still takes space = 0, but not display:none */
  visibility:hidden;               /* don't flash on screen   */
}
```

Toggle it by swapping `visibility`/`left` instead of `display`. Nodes keep valid bounding boxes, so `mermaid.run()` can be called at any time ([GitHub][2]).

---

## 3  Upgrade note

A patch that guards against zero-vector division was merged in February 2025 (PR #6329) ([Buttondown][5]) and will land in the next point release (≥ **11.6.1** – absent from CDN at the time of writing). Upgrading will stop the hard crash, but layouts rendered while hidden will still come out blank, so you should still change the rendering order.

---

## 4  Drop-in code change for your project

Below is a minimal diff for `src/web/script.js` (line numbers approximate). It implements *fix 2.1* and preserves your existing logic:

```diff
-        previewModalContent.innerHTML = htmlContentToPreview; 
-        
-        // Run Mermaid on the preview content
-        try {
-            if (typeof mermaid?.run === 'function') {
-                const mermaidElements = previewModalContent.querySelectorAll('.mermaid');
-                console.log(`[Preview] Found ${mermaidElements.length} elements with class 'mermaid' for Mermaid.run().`);
-                if (mermaidElements.length > 0) {
-                    await mermaid.run({ nodes: mermaidElements });
-                    console.log("[Preview] Client-side Mermaid.run() executed.");
-                }
-            } else {
-                console.warn("[Preview] Mermaid.run() not available or mermaidElements not found.");
-            }
-        } catch (e) {
+        previewModalContent.innerHTML = htmlContentToPreview;
+
+        /* ---------- new order: show → rAF → render ---------- */
+        previewModalOverlay.style.display = 'flex';
+        await new Promise(requestAnimationFrame);
+
+        try {
+            const mermaidElements = previewModalContent.querySelectorAll('.mermaid');
+            if (mermaidElements.length) await mermaid.run({ nodes: mermaidElements });
+        } catch (e) {
             console.error("[Preview] Error running Mermaid on preview content:", e);
             const errorDiv = document.createElement('div');
             errorDiv.style.color = 'red';
             errorDiv.textContent = "Error rendering Mermaid diagram in preview: " + (e.message || e.str || 'Unknown error');
             previewModalContent.appendChild(errorDiv);
         }
-
-        fileNameInputModal.value = `pubmd_doc_${new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10).replace(/-/g,'')}.pdf`;
-        previewModalOverlay.style.display = 'flex';
+        fileNameInputModal.value = `pubmd_doc_${new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10).replace(/-/g,'')}.pdf`;
```

That one change should eliminate the error for all diagrams, even the ultra-simple `graph TD; A-->B;` test case.

# Gemini 2.5 Pro reply:
This is an excellent and very sharp analysis! You've hit the nail on the head.

Your reasoning that **Mermaid is attempting to render the diagram while its container (`#previewModalOverlay`) is set to `display:none`** is almost certainly the correct diagnosis for the "Could not find a suitable point for the given distance" error.

Here's a breakdown of why your analysis is spot-on:

1.  **The `display:none` Problem:** It's a well-known issue in web development that elements (or their children) with `display:none` are not part of the render tree and thus have no calculable dimensions (width/height are effectively zero). Libraries like Mermaid that rely on measuring elements to perform layout calculations (in this case, via Dagre for graph layout) will fail, often with cryptic errors like the one you're seeing, if they try to operate on these hidden elements. The division by zero you mentioned in Dagre's intersection math is a classic consequence.

2.  **Corroborating Evidence:** Your references to GitHub issues () where other users experienced the exact same error due to rendering Mermaid diagrams in hidden containers (tabs, modals not yet shown, elements styled with `display:none`) strongly support your conclusion.

3.  **Your Code's Logic Flow:** You correctly identified that in `prepareContentForPreviewAndPdf()`, `mermaid.run()` is called *before* `previewModalOverlay.style.display = 'flex';` makes the modal visible. This timing is the critical flaw.

**Evaluation of Your Proposed Fixes:**

Both of your suggested fixes are practical and address the core issue effectively:

*   **Fix 2.1 (Show first, render second):**
    ```javascript
    // make overlay visible *before* rendering
    previewModalOverlay.style.display = 'flex';

    /* wait until the browser has done a layout pass
       so nodes have non-zero sizes.
       Using rAF avoids an arbitrary setTimeout. */
    await new Promise(requestAnimationFrame);

    await mermaid.run({ nodes: previewModalContent.querySelectorAll('.mermaid') });
    ```
    This is an excellent solution. Making the container visible first allows the browser to compute its layout. Using `await new Promise(requestAnimationFrame)` is a clean and efficient way to ensure that the layout pass is complete before `mermaid.run()` attempts to measure and draw the diagram. This should resolve the error.

*   **Fix 2.2 (Keep the container in the render-tree):**
    Using `visibility:hidden; position:fixed; left:-9999px;` instead of `display:none` for the hidden state of the modal is another robust approach. Elements styled with `visibility:hidden` still occupy space in the layout and have dimensions, even though they are not painted. This means Mermaid can successfully calculate the layout at any time. This method can also be beneficial for performance by avoiding the layout reflows that can occur when toggling `display:none`.

**Upgrade Note (Mermaid ≥ 11.6.1):**
Your observation about the upcoming patch (PR #6329) is valuable. While upgrading will prevent the hard crash, your advice to still fix the rendering order is crucial because a diagram rendered while hidden (even if it doesn't crash) will likely render incorrectly or as blank. The fix addresses the symptom (the crash) but not necessarily the root cause of an incorrect render in a hidden state.

**Drop-in Code Change:**
The diff you provided for `src/web/script.js` implementing Fix 2.1 is correct and should directly address the problem.

**Regarding Your "Extra tips & checks":**

*   **Call `mermaid.initialize()` once, early:** Generally, yes. However, in your `script.js`, `mermaid.initialize()` is also called within `updateUIStates`. This is likely necessary because you're changing the `theme` (and potentially `fontFamily` which I also recommended in my prior advice). Mermaid.js typically requires re-initialization to apply new configuration options like themes. If `mermaid.initialize` weren't called again, the theme change might not take effect for subsequent renders. So, the initial call on `DOMContentLoaded` is good, and the calls in `updateUIStates` are likely justified for dynamic theme/font updates.
*   **Don’t sanitize away the `<svg>`:** Your current DOMPurify config looks okay for Mermaid's basic needs (`div` and `class`). Your advice to remember SVG-specific elements if profiles get stricter is prudent.
*   **Watch for future failures in dark-mode themes:** Excellent point. Theme-related CSS variable overrides can indeed cause visibility issues.
*   **Remove orphaned `:::hidden` classDefs:** Also correct. Hiding nodes *within* the diagram syntax itself could theoretically lead to similar measurement issues for Dagre.

**In summary:**

Your analysis is thorough, accurate, and provides a clear path to resolution. The `display:none` issue is the most compelling explanation for the error you're experiencing. Implementing either of your proposed fixes, particularly "Show first, render second" as per your diff, should solve the "Could not find a suitable point for the given distance" error.

My previous advice regarding explicit font settings in `mermaid.initialize()` is still good practice for ensuring consistent rendering *after* this visibility issue is resolved, but your analysis correctly identifies the primary blocker.
