Understood. It seems we've hit a particularly stubborn issue with Playwright's PDF font rendering that isn't yielding to the common troubleshooting steps. Given the time and the fact that the generated HTML (`debug_pdf_content.html`) *is* correct when viewed in a browser, it's reasonable to treat this as a deeper issue, potentially within Playwright itself or its interaction with the specific font files/OS, that would require more extensive investigation than we can do right now.

I will document this as a bug.

**Bug Report: PDF Font Rendering Issue with Playwright**

**1. Summary:**
The server-side PDF generation using `@pubmd/core` (which internally uses Playwright via `PlaywrightPdfEngine`) fails to render the selected custom font (DejaVu Serif or DejaVu Sans) in the main body of the PDF. Instead, it defaults to a generic sans-serif font. This occurs even though the HTML content provided to Playwright for PDF conversion correctly includes base64-encoded `@font-face` rules and CSS `font-family` declarations that work as expected when the same HTML is viewed directly in a standard web browser.

**2. Environment:**
*   Node.js environment
*   `@pubmd/core` package for PDF and Markdown services
*   Playwright (via `@pubmd/core`) for PDF generation
*   Fonts: DejaVu Sans TTF, DejaVu Serif TTF (base64 encoded in CSS)

**3. Steps to Reproduce:**
    1.  Client selects a font preference (e.g., "serif").
    2.  Client sends Markdown content and font preference to the server API (`/api/generate-pdf-from-markdown`).
    3.  Server (`nodejs_projects/server/src/index.ts`) loads the corresponding DejaVu font (e.g., DejaVuSerif.ttf), base64 encodes it, and constructs an HTML string. This HTML string includes:
        *   `@font-face` rules with the base64 font data (e.g., `font-family: 'DejaVu Serif'; src: url(data:font/ttf;base64,...)`).
        *   CSS rules applying this font to the body (e.g., `body { font-family: 'DejaVu Serif', serif; }`).
    4.  This HTML is passed to `PdfService.generatePdfFromHtml()`, which uses `PlaywrightPdfEngine`.
    5.  `PlaywrightPdfEngine` calls `page.setContent(html, { waitUntil: '...' })` and then `page.pdf()`.
    6.  The server saves a debug copy of the HTML passed to Playwright (`debug_pdf_content.html`).

**4. Expected Behavior:**
*   The main body text in the generated PDF should be rendered using the specified custom font (e.g., DejaVu Serif).
*   The `debug_pdf_content.html` file, when opened in a browser, should show the correct custom font.

**5. Actual Behavior:**
*   The main body text in the generated PDF is rendered using a generic sans-serif font, not the specified DejaVu font.
*   The `debug_pdf_content.html` file, when opened in a browser, *correctly* shows the specified custom font (e.g., DejaVu Serif) for the main body text. This confirms the HTML and CSS are correctly formed.
*   Mermaid diagrams within the PDF also render with a default sans-serif font, not the selected custom font. (This is a related but distinct issue, as the Mermaid SVG generation step in `MarkdownService` does not currently inject the custom `@font-face` rules into its own Playwright rendering context).

**6. Troubleshooting Steps Attempted (for main body PDF font):**
    *   Verified server logs: Correct font preference received, correct CSS `font-family` logged as being applied.
    *   Verified `debug_pdf_content.html`: Renders correctly with the custom font in a standard browser.
    *   Changed `page.setContent()` in `PlaywrightPdfEngine` `waitUntil` option from `domcontentloaded` to `load`, and then to `networkidle`. None of these resolved the PDF font issue.
    *   Ensured `printBackground: true` is used for `page.pdf()`.

**7. Possible Root Cause (Hypothesis):**
The issue appears to be specific to how Playwright's `page.pdf()` method (or the underlying Chromium PDF rendering engine it uses) handles or embeds base64-encoded fonts defined via `@font-face` from the provided HTML, despite the HTML itself being valid and rendering correctly in a full browser environment. This could be a limitation, a subtle bug in Playwright/Chromium, or an interaction with the specific font files that only manifests during PDF conversion.

**8. Affected Code Areas:**
*   `nodejs_projects/core/src/services/pdf/playwright.engine.ts` (Interaction with `page.pdf()`)
*   `nodejs_projects/server/src/index.ts` (HTML and CSS generation - though this part seems correct based on `debug_pdf_content.html` behavior in a browser)

**9. Suggested Next Steps for Investigation (Future):**
    *   Test with a known-simple, standard web font (e.g., Open Sans) embedded as base64 to see if the issue is specific to DejaVu fonts or all base64 fonts.
    *   Create an absolutely minimal HTML test case (just one line of text and the base64 DejaVu font) and try to generate a PDF from it with Playwright directly (outside the current project structure) to isolate the Playwright behavior.
    *   Experiment with Playwright's `page.addStyleTag()` to inject the `@font-face` rules separately from `page.setContent()`.
    *   Investigate if there are any Playwright launch options for `chromium.launch()` that might affect font loading or sandboxing in the PDF context.
    *   Check Playwright and Chromium issue trackers for similar reported problems with base64 font embedding in PDFs.
    *   Consider testing with a different PDF generation engine if Playwright continues to be problematic for this specific requirement.
