# Business Requirements: Markdown to PDF Converter

## 1. Problem/Opportunity Statement
The project aims to provide a reliable and flexible Markdown to PDF conversion solution.

## 2. Key Objectives/Goals
*   Offer users multiple ways to interact with the converter, specifically through a web-based User Interface (UI) and a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

## 3. Primary Stakeholders & Their Needs
*   **Technical Users (e.g., Developers):**
    *   Need: A CLI for automation, scripting, and integration into workflows.
    *   Need: The CLI version must be installable via a popular, standardized, and appropriate method, making the command readily available for use in a bash shell.
*   **Non-Technical Users:**
    *   Need: An easy-to-use web UI for straightforward, ad-hoc conversions.

## 4. Essential Outcomes/Success Criteria
*   Overall project success is defined as having a stable web UI and a functional CLI version that share a common, maintainable core logic, capable of accurately rendering basic Markdown to PDF.

## 5. High-Level Must-Have Capabilities

### Phase 1: Architectural Evolution
*   Core PDF generation logic is successfully refactored into reusable software components.
*   An initial CLI structural framework is established.
*   The existing web UI continues to function correctly using the newly refactored components.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality & Bug Fixes
*   Both the web UI and the CLI versions can produce PDF documents with:
    *   Corrected list rendering (e.g., resolving missing hyphens for unordered lists).
    *   Functional heading-based navigation within the PDF (e.g., clickable table of contents or bookmarks).

## 6. System Interactions
*   The tool is standalone and does not require integration with other systems at this stage.
