# CRCT Summary: Mermaid Theming for PDF Generation (as of 2025-05-22 End of Day)

The primary goal is to enable server-side PDF generation with user-selectable Mermaid themes and fonts.

**Completed:**
- Core MarkdownService (`@pubmd/core`) updated to accept theme/font options and use Playwright to render Mermaid diagrams with injected CSS and theme variables.
- Core PdfService (`@pubmd/core`) updated to pass these options to MarkdownService.
- Client-side script (`src/web/script.js`) updated to send theme/font preferences to the server.
- Server endpoint (`nodejs_projects/server/src/index.ts`) updated to receive these preferences.
- `copy-assets.mjs` script in `@pubmd/core` updated to include `mermaid-themes.css` in the build output.
- Client-side bug fix in `src/web/script.js` for missing UI element (`fileNameInputModal`) during PDF preview.

**Current Issue:**
- User reports that Mermaid font and theme selections made in the client-side preview are NOT respected in the final generated PDF.
- This is highly likely due to persistent TypeScript build errors in `nodejs_projects/server/src/index.ts` where the server is not correctly recognizing updated types from `@pubmd/core`. Temporary `any` casts were added to `server/src/index.ts` to allow it to build, but these likely prevent correct option passing (e.g., using `mermaidTheme` where `mermaidRenderTheme` was intended for `MarkdownParseOptions`).

**Next Steps (when resuming):**
1.  **User Action:** Resolve TypeScript environment issues in `nodejs_projects/server`. This involves:
    *   Rebuilding the `@pubmd/core` package (e.g., `pnpm --filter @pubmd/core build`).
    *   Updating/reinstalling dependencies for the server project or the entire workspace (e.g., `pnpm install`).
    *   Restarting the TypeScript server in the IDE (e.g., VS Code).

2.  **Code Action (after user confirms TS environment is fixed):**
    *   In `nodejs_projects/server/src/index.ts`, revert the temporary `any` casts.
    *   Ensure `clientPdfOptions.mermaidTheme` (from the request) is correctly passed as `mermaidRenderTheme` to `markdownService.parse()`.
    *   Ensure `clientPdfOptions.fontPreference` (from the request) is correctly passed as `fontPreference` to `markdownService.parse()`.
    *   The `req.body` destructuring should correctly use the (now hopefully resolved) `PdfGenerationOptions` type for `pdfOptions`.

3.  **Debugging (if the issue persists after fixing the server's type resolution and code):**
    *   Verify options are correctly received and processed in `nodejs_projects/server/src/index.ts`.
    *   Trace options flow into `nodejs_projects/core/src/services/markdown/markdown.service.ts` (specifically the `parse` and `renderMermaidPage` methods).
    *   Inspect the intermediate HTML/SVG generated by Playwright within the `renderMermaidPage` method to see if theme/font classes and styles are being applied as expected to the Mermaid diagram wrapper and its contents.
    *   Review `src/web/mermaid-themes.css` (and its copied version in `core/dist/assets`) for correctness and specificity of CSS rules.
