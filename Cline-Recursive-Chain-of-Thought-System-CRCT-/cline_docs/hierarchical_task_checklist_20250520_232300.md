# Hierarchical Task Checklist

**Purpose**: To provide a hierarchical overview of all modules, implementation plans, and tasks in the project, enabling quick identification of completed and pending work. Check off items as they are completed to track progress during the Strategy and Execution phases.

- [ ] **System Manifest (`system_manifest.md`)**
  - [ ] Review and update complete (Deferred for this cycle)

- [x] **Executed & Refined** - **Playwright PDF Engine SVG Correction (`nodejs_projects/core/src/services/pdf/playwright.engine.ts`)**
  - [x] Module-level (or equivalent file-level) review and update complete (Initial update directly per user instruction, TypeScript errors resolved)
  - [x] Module-level refinement complete (Commented out `<foreignObject>` correction block post `htmlLabels:false` pivot)
  - [x] **Implementation Plan - Playwright SVG Fixes (`documentation/03_Implementation/issue_research_20250521_mermaid-diagram-issue_gemini.md`)**
    - [x] Plan content review and update complete (Reviewed, served as direct implementation guide for initial update)
    - [x] **(Single Execution Action)**: Replace content of `playwright.engine.ts` with code from research document.

- [x] **Executed** - **Mermaid Text-Only Rendering Pivot (`nodejs_projects/core/src/services/markdown/markdown.service.ts`)**
  - [x] Module-level update complete (Updated to set `htmlLabels: false` for Mermaid, TS errors bypassed)
  - [x] **Implementation Plan - Mermaid Text-Only Pivot (`documentation/03_Implementation/issue_research_20250521_mermaid-diagram-issue_take8_pivot_o3_mermaid_text_only.md`)**
    - [x] Plan content review complete (Reviewed, served as implementation guide)
    - [x] **(Execution Action)**: Modify `mermaid.initialize` in `markdown.service.ts`.

## Progress Summary
- **Completed Items**: 
    - Direct execution of "Playwright PDF Engine SVG Correction" is complete. `playwright.engine.ts` has been updated and subsequently refined.
    - Execution of "Mermaid Text-Only Rendering Pivot" is complete. `markdown.service.ts` has been updated.
- **Next Priority Tasks**: Update `.clinerules`. Consider testing the combined changes.
- **Notes**: This cycle focused on resolving SVG rendering issues in PDFs through direct file modifications based on research documents. Task decomposition bypassed.

**Instructions**:
- Check off `[ ]` to `[x]` for each item as it is completed.
- Update the "Progress Summary" section periodically to reflect the current state.
- Use this checklist to quickly identify the next task or area requiring attention.
