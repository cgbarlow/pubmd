# Active Context

**Current Task**: Refined `playwright.engine.ts` after Mermaid text-only pivot.

**Overall Cycle Goals (Largely Completed)**:
1.  **[COMPLETED]** Directly replace the content of `nodejs_projects/core/src/services/pdf/playwright.engine.ts` with lines 26-208 from `documentation/03_Implementation/issue_research_20250521_mermaid-diagram-issue_gemini.md`. (SVG Patching Approach)
2.  **[COMPLETED]** Pivot to text-only Mermaid rendering: Modify `nodejs_projects/core/src/services/markdown/markdown.service.ts` to configure Mermaid with `htmlLabels: false` for `flowchart`, `sequence`, and `state` diagrams.
    *   Reference Plan: [`documentation/03_Implementation/issue_research_20250521_mermaid-diagram-issue_take8_pivot_o3_mermaid_text_only.md`](documentation/03_Implementation/issue_research_20250521_mermaid-diagram-issue_take8_pivot_o3_mermaid_text_only.md)
3.  **[COMPLETED]** Refine `playwright.engine.ts`: Commented out the `<foreignObject>` correction block in the DOM manipulation script, as it's likely redundant due to the `htmlLabels: false` setting.

**`current_planning_area`**: "Mermaid PDF Rendering Improvement" (Status: Refinement of `playwright.engine.ts` complete)

**Current State**:
- `playwright.engine.ts` was initially updated with SVG patching logic.
- `markdown.service.ts` has been updated to initialize Mermaid with `htmlLabels: false`.
- The `<foreignObject>` specific correction in `playwright.engine.ts` has been commented out.

**Next Steps**:
1.  Update [`changelog.md`](Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/cline_docs/changelog.md:1).
2.  Update [`hdta_review_progress_20250520_232300.md`](Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/cline_docs/hdta_review_progress_20250520_232300.md:1).
3.  Update [`hierarchical_task_checklist_20250520_232300.md`](Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/cline_docs/hierarchical_task_checklist_20250520_232300.md:1).
4.  Update [`.clinerules`](Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/.clinerules:1) to reflect task completion.
5.  Consider next steps: Testing the combined changes.
