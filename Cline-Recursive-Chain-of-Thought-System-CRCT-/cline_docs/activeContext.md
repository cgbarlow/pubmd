# Active Context

**Current Task**: Strategy Phase - Step 5: Sequencing Execution Tasks for "Server Auto-Start/Stop Feature".

**Overall Cycle Goals (Strategy Phase - Focused Session):**
1.  Review and finalize the strategy outlined in `cline_docs/tasks/Strategy_Task_Server_Auto_Start_Stop_20250524.md`. (Completed)
2.  Prepare for the creation of detailed Execution Tasks based on this strategy. (Completed - All 9 Execution Tasks created)

**`current_planning_area`**: Server Auto-Start/Stop Feature

**Strategy Phase Progress:**
*   **Step 0 (Initialize Strategy Cycle): Completed.**
*   **Step 1 (Select Area for Focused Planning): Completed.**
*   **Step 2 (Focused Dependency Analysis for Selected Area): Completed.**
*   **Step 3 & 4 (Review/Refine HDTA & Decompose into Atomic Tasks): Completed.**
    *   The strategy document `cline_docs/tasks/Strategy_Task_Server_Auto_Start_Stop_20250524.md` was reviewed.
    *   Its conceptual phases have been decomposed and formalized into 9 Execution Task files:
        1.  `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Server_Socket_Activation.md`
        2.  `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Server_Graceful_Shutdown.md`
        3.  `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Server_Inactivity_Termination.md`
        4.  `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Systemd_Socket_File.md`
        5.  `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Systemd_Service_File.md`
        6.  `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Build_Server.md`
        7.  `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Deploy_Systemd_Units.md`
        8.  `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Test_Server_Functionality.md`
        9.  `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Document_Feature.md`
*   **Step 5 (Sequence Atomic Tasks): In Progress.**

**Proposed Execution Sequence for "Server Auto-Start/Stop Feature":**

1.  **Parallel Group 1 (Server Code Modifications):**
    *   Task 1: `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Server_Socket_Activation.md`
    *   Task 2: `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Server_Graceful_Shutdown.md` (depends on Task 1)
    *   Task 3: `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Server_Inactivity_Termination.md` (depends on Task 1, Task 2)

2.  **Parallel Group 2 (Systemd File Creation - can be done concurrently with Group 1):**
    *   Task 4: `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Systemd_Socket_File.md`
    *   Task 5: `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Systemd_Service_File.md` (depends on Task 4)

3.  **Sequential Step 3 (Build - depends on Group 1 completion):**
    *   Task 6: `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Build_Server.md` (depends on Tasks 1, 2, 3)

4.  **Sequential Step 4 (Deploy - depends on Group 2 and Step 3 completion):**
    *   Task 7: `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Deploy_Systemd_Units.md` (depends on Tasks 4, 5, 6)

5.  **Sequential Step 5 (Test - depends on Step 4 completion):**
    *   Task 8: `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Test_Server_Functionality.md` (depends on Task 7)

6.  **Sequential Step 6 (Document - depends on Step 5 completion):**
    *   Task 9: `tasks/server_auto_start_stop/Execution_Document_Feature.md` (depends on Task 8)

**Current State & Next Steps (Strategy Phase):**
*   All Execution Tasks for the "Server Auto-Start/Stop Feature" have been defined.
*   The proposed execution sequence is outlined above.
*   The next step is to finalize this sequence and consider this focused planning session complete.
*   The `Strategy_Task_Server_Auto_Start_Stop_20250524.md` can be marked as fully planned.

**Server-Side Build Issue (Ongoing - Prerequisite for PDF Theming Fix if revisited):** (No changes this turn)
