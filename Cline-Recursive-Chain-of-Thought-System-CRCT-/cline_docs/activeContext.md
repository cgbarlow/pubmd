# Active Context

**Current Task**: Executing [`Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md`](cline_docs/tasks/Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md:1).

**Overall Cycle Goal**: Integrate the `@pubmd/core` package into the existing web UI.

**Last MUP Action**: (This will be updated by current MUP)

**Recent Actions & State Change**:
- User indicated that Node.js projects should not reside within the `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-` directory.
- The `@pubmd/core` package was moved from `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core` to `/workspaces/pubmd/nodejs_projects/core`.
- [`Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/.clinerules`](Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/.clinerules:1) `[CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]` updated to reflect the new path: `../nodejs_projects/core`.
- Paths within [`Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md`](cline_docs/tasks/Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md:1) updated to `nodejs_projects/core`.

**Current State**:
- Execution phase ongoing.
- Currently executing: [`Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md`](cline_docs/tasks/Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md:1)
  - Step 1 (Navigate to Package Directory) was completed for the *old* path. This step will need to be re-evaluated for the new path `nodejs_projects/core`.
  - Original Step 2 (`npm run build`) FAILED: `npm` command not found.
  - Task plan updated to include `npm install` as new Step 2, with `npm run build` as Step 3.
- The task is currently blocked pending resolution of the `npm` command not being found. This prevents both `npm install` and `npm run build`.

**Next Steps**:
- Await user resolution of the `npm` command not found issue (ensure Node.js/npm installed and in PATH, or provide full path to `npm`).
- Once `npm` is available, proceed with Step 1 (Navigate to Package Directory) of [`Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md`](cline_docs/tasks/Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md:1) using the new path `nodejs_projects/core`.
- Then attempt Step 2 (`npm install`) in `nodejs_projects/core`.
