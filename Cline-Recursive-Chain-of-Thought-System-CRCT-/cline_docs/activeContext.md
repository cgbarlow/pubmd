# Active Context

**Current Task**: Concluding streamlined Strategy Phase for Playwright PDF engine issue. Preparing for direct execution based on user instruction.

**Overall Cycle Goals (Confirmed & Streamlined)**:
1.  Directly replace the content of `nodejs_projects/core/src/services/pdf/playwright.engine.ts` with lines 26-208 from `documentation/03_Implementation/issue_research_20250521_mermaid-diagram-issue_gemini.md`. This addresses:
    *   Injecting JavaScript via `page.evaluate()` for DOM corrections on Mermaid SVGs.
    *   Resizing `<foreignObject>` elements.
    *   Fixing malformed `transform` attributes.
    *   Adjusting SVG `viewBox`.
    *   Adding browser console forwarding.
Reference Plan & Source Code: [`documentation/03_Implementation/issue_research_20250521_mermaid-diagram-issue_gemini.md`](documentation/03_Implementation/issue_research_20250521_mermaid-diagram-issue_gemini.md) (lines 26-208)

**Strategy Phase Update**:
- User confirmed a streamlined approach: bypass detailed task decomposition and proceed with direct file content replacement.
- The "Playwright PDF Engine SVG Correction" area planning is considered complete by adopting the user's direct instruction.
- No separate `Execution_Task.md` will be created for this specific action.

**`current_planning_area`**: "Playwright PDF Engine SVG Correction" (Status: Planning Complete - Direct Execution Instructed)

**Current State**:
- Streamlined Strategy Phase concluding.
- Preparing to transition to Execution Phase.

**Next Steps**:
1.  Update `hdta_review_progress_20250520_232300.md`.
2.  Update `hierarchical_task_checklist_20250520_232300.md`.
3.  Update `.clinerules` to transition to Execution Phase.
4.  Execute the file replacement as instructed by the user.
