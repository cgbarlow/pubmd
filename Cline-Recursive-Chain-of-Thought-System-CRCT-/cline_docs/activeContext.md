# Active Context

**Current Task**: Documented client-side Mermaid rendering error and awaiting next steps for debugging.

**Overall Cycle Goals**:
1.  **[COMPLETED]** Identify and document the client-side Mermaid rendering error ("Could not find a suitable point for the given distance").
2.  **[IN PROGRESS]** Debug and resolve the client-side Mermaid rendering error in the preview modal.
    *   Hypothesis: Font metrics, CSS conflicts, SVG rendering context, or Mermaid configuration.
    *   Attempted (paused): Explicitly setting `fontFamily` in `mermaid.initialize()`.

**`current_planning_area`**: "Client-Side Mermaid Rendering Debugging"

**Current State**:
- Client-side Mermaid rendering in the preview modal is failing with the error "Could not find a suitable point for the given distance".
- A problem statement document has been created: `documentation/03_Implementation/problem_statement-ClientSideMermaidRenderingError_20250522.md`.
- The web application uses `marked`, `DOMPurify`, and `Mermaid.js` (v11.6.0) via import map for client-side preview.
- Custom fonts ('DejaVu Sans', 'DejaVu Serif') are loaded via `@font-face`.
- An attempt to set `fontFamily` in `mermaid.initialize()` was prepared but paused by user instruction.

**Next Steps**:
1.  Update CRCT documents (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `doc_tracker.md`).
2.  Awaiting further instructions from the user for the next debugging step.
