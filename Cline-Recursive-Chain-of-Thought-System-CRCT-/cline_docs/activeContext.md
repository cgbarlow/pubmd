# Active Context

**Current Task**: Executing `Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md`.

**Overall Cycle Goal**: Integrate the `@pubmd/core` package into the existing web UI.

**Last MUP Action**: Updated `.clinerules` on 2025-05-19 12:29:48 PM. (This will be updated by current MUP)

**Current State**:
- Execution phase ongoing.
- Currently executing: [`Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md`](cline_docs/tasks/Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md:1)
  - Step 1 (Navigate to Package Directory) completed.
  - Original Step 2 (`npm run build`) FAILED: `npm` command not found.
  - Task plan updated to include `npm install` as new Step 2, with `npm run build` as Step 3.
- The task is currently blocked pending resolution of the `npm` command not being found. This prevents both `npm install` and `npm run build`.

**Next Steps**:
- Re-iterated to the user the need to resolve the `npm` command not found issue (ensure Node.js/npm installed and in PATH, or provide full path to `npm`).
- Await user response before attempting the new Step 2 (`npm install`) in [`Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md`](cline_docs/tasks/Execution_Task_Core_BuildPackage_20250519_121000.md:27).
