<p>Here&#39;s a simplified, non-technical version written for a general audience:</p>

<h1>Family History App – Stage 1 Prototype: What It Will Do</h1>
<p>This document explains what the first version of the <em>Family History</em> app will include. This early prototype focuses on a single family living in Stalowa Wola, Poland, during the 1960s. All information is pre-filled — nothing is created by AI just yet.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. What the App Is Made Of</h2>
<h3>People (Family Members)</h3>
<p>Each person in the family will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A name and basic life details (birth date, death date if known, job, personality, and key life events in the 1960s).</li>
<li>A short personal story (about a page long).</li>
<li>A photo or image representing them.</li>
<li>Information about who they’re related to (e.g. parents, children, spouse).</li>
<li>A starting point for conversation with the user.</li>
<li>A scene or place they appear in (e.g. kitchen, garden, steelworks).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dates</h3>
<p>Because exact dates aren’t always known in history, the app can show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific dates (like 15 March 1925)</li>
<li>Approximate ones (like &quot;early March 1945&quot; or &quot;circa 1920&quot;)</li>
<li>Date ranges (e.g. &quot;1923–1925&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conversations</h3>
<p>You can &quot;talk&quot; to the family members through a Q&amp;A interaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>You start by clicking on a person in a scene.</li>
<li>The person might say something first.</li>
<li>Then you pick a question from a list to ask them.</li>
<li>Based on your choice, they’ll respond, and new questions may appear.</li>
<li>If a conversation path ends, you can go back and try a different question.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scenes (Places)</h3>
<p>Scenes help set the mood and context. They might show places like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A family kitchen</li>
<li>A garden</li>
<li>A steelworks factory</li>
</ul>
<p>Each scene shows who’s present and where it is.</p>
<h3>Historical Info</h3>
<p>There will be an area where you can read about real-life topics from that time and place, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What housing was like in 1960s Poland</li>
<li>What it was like working in a steel mill</li>
<li>How children were educated back then</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>2. How You’ll Use It</h2>
<ul>
<li>You’ll start by seeing a scene with some family members.</li>
<li>Click on someone to start a conversation.</li>
<li>Choose questions to ask them, and learn about their life.</li>
<li>When a conversation thread finishes, you can backtrack and try different questions.</li>
<li>You can explore scenes and read more about the historical background separately.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
