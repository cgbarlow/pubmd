# Task: Execution_Build_@pubmd_core_Package
   **Parent:** `cline_docs/tasks/Execution_Task_WebUI_VerifyCorePackage_20250519_115800.md`
   **Children:** None
   **Status:** Completed

## Objective
Build the `@pubmd/core` package by installing its dependencies and executing its defined build script to generate the necessary JavaScript artifacts in the `dist` directory, making it available for import.

## Context
- The `@pubmd/core` package is located at `nodejs_projects/core`.
- Its `package.json` (Key `1B1`, path: `nodejs_projects/core/package.json`) contains a build script: `"build": "tsc -p tsconfig.build.json && tsc -p tsconfig.esm.json"` and lists `devDependencies` such as `typescript`.
- `tsconfig.build.json` (Key `1B2`, path: `nodejs_projects/core/tsconfig.build.json`) specifies `outDir: "./dist"`.
- `tsconfig.esm.json` (Key `1B3`, path: `nodejs_projects/core/tsconfig.esm.json`) specifies `outDir: "./dist/esm"`.
- The previous verification task (`Execution_Task_WebUI_VerifyCorePackage_20250519_115800.md`) confirmed that the `dist` directory and its build artifacts are currently missing.
- The build command needs to be executed from within the `nodejs_projects/core` directory.
- User feedback indicates `npm install` should be run first.

## Steps & Results

1.  **Relocate Package & Update Paths (Unplanned)**:
    *   Action: Moved `@pubmd/core` from `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core` to `nodejs_projects/core` based on user feedback regarding project structure. Updated relevant CRCT files and task paths.
    *   **Result (2025-05-19 12:37:35 AM - 12:39:27 AM):** Success. Package relocated and configurations updated.

2.  **Navigate to Package Directory**:
    *   Action: Ensure current working directory is `nodejs_projects/core`.
    *   Tool: `execute_command` (implicitly, as subsequent commands were run in this CWD).
    *   **Result (Effective as of 2025-05-19 12:39:47 AM):** Success. Subsequent commands executed in `nodejs_projects/core`.

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    *   Action: Run `npm install` to install package dependencies. This initially failed due to `npm` not found, then due to `typescript` missing from `devDependencies`.
    *   Tool: `execute_command` (`npm install`).
    *   **Result (2025-05-19 12:39:47 AM):** `npm install` run.
    *   **Result (2025-05-19 12:42:56 AM):** `typescript` added to `devDependencies` and `npm install` run again successfully.
        ```
        added 1 package, and audited 2 packages in 1s
        found 0 vulnerabilities
        ```
    *   **Status:** Completed.

4.  **Execute Build Script**:
    *   Action: Run the package's build script (`npm run build`). This involved several iterations to fix `tsc` not found, missing `src/index.ts`, incorrect `tsconfig.json` `extends` paths, and incompatible `module`/`moduleResolution` settings.
    *   Tool: `execute_command` (`npm run build`).
    *   **Initial Attempts:** Failed due to `tsc` not found, then various TypeScript configuration errors (TS5083, TS18003, TS5069, TS5070, TS5110).
    *   **Corrective Actions:**
        *   Added `typescript` to `devDependencies` in `package.json`.
        *   Added `declaration: true` to `tsconfig.build.json`.
        *   Created `nodejs_projects/core/src/index.ts` with minimal export.
        *   Corrected `extends` paths in `tsconfig.build.json` and `tsconfig.esm.json` to `../../Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/tsconfig.json`.
        *   Set `moduleResolution: "nodenext"` and `module: "NodeNext"` in `tsconfig.esm.json`.
    *   **Result (2025-05-19 01:01:21 AM):** Success.
        ```
        > @pubmd/core@0.1.0 build
        > tsc -p tsconfig.build.json && tsc -p tsconfig.esm.json
        ```
    *   **Status:** Completed.

5.  **Verify `dist` Directory Creation**:
    *   Action: Check if the `dist` directory now exists within `nodejs_projects/core`.
    *   Tool: `list_files` on `nodejs_projects/core/dist`.
    *   **Result (2025-05-19 01:57:43 AM):** Success. `dist` directory and its contents (`index.d.ts`, `index.js`, `index.js.map`, `esm/`) confirmed.
    *   **Status:** Completed.

6.  **Verify Main Build Artifacts**:
    *   Action: Check for the existence of `index.js` and `index.d.ts` in `nodejs_projects/core/dist/`.
    *   Tool: `list_files` on `nodejs_projects/core/dist/`.
    *   **Result (2025-05-19 01:57:43 AM):** Success. `index.js` and `index.d.ts` confirmed.
    *   **Status:** Completed.

7.  **Verify ESM Build Artifacts**:
    *   Action: Check for the existence of `index.js` in `nodejs_projects/core/dist/esm/`.
    *   Tool: `list_files` on `nodejs_projects/core/dist/esm/`.
    *   **Result (2025-05-19 01:57:50 AM):** Success. `index.js` (and `index.js.map`) confirmed in `dist/esm/`.
    *   **Status:** Completed.

8.  **Document Outcome**:
    *   Action: Record the success of the build process.
    *   **Result:** The `@pubmd/core` package was successfully built after resolving several configuration issues. The `dist` directory and all expected CommonJS and ESM artifacts (`index.js`, `index.d.ts`) are present.
    *   **Status:** Completed.
