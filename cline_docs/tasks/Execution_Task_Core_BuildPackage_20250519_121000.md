# Task: Execution_Build_@pubmd_core_Package
   **Parent:** `cline_docs/tasks/Execution_Task_WebUI_VerifyCorePackage_20250519_115800.md`
   **Children:** None
   **Status:** In Progress (Blocked)

## Objective
Build the `@pubmd/core` package by installing its dependencies and executing its defined build script to generate the necessary JavaScript artifacts in the `dist` directory, making it available for import.

## Context
- The `@pubmd/core` package is located at `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core`.
- Its `package.json` (Key `1B1`, path: `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/package.json`) contains a build script: `"build": "tsc -p tsconfig.build.json && tsc -p tsconfig.esm.json"` and lists `devDependencies` such as `typescript`.
- `tsconfig.build.json` (Key `1B2`, path: `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/tsconfig.build.json`) specifies `outDir: "./dist"`.
- `tsconfig.esm.json` (Key `1B3`, path: `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/tsconfig.esm.json`) specifies `outDir: "./dist/esm"`.
- The previous verification task (`Execution_Task_WebUI_VerifyCorePackage_20250519_115800.md`) confirmed that the `dist` directory and its build artifacts are currently missing.
- The build command needs to be executed from within the `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core` directory.
- User feedback indicates `npm install` should be run first.

## Steps & Results

1.  **Navigate to Package Directory**:
    *   Action: Change the current working directory to `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core`.
    *   Tool: `execute_command` (`cd Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core`).
    *   **Result (2025-05-19 12:11:10 PM):** Success. Working directory changed to `c:/NotBackedUp/pubmd/Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core`.

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    *   Action: Run `npm install` to install package dependencies, including `devDependencies` like `typescript`.
    *   Tool: `execute_command` (e.g., `npm install` or `[full_path_to_npm] install`).
    *   Note: This step is contingent on `npm` being recognized by the system.
    *   **Status:** Pending. Blocked by `npm` command not being found.

3.  **Execute Build Script**:
    *   Action: Run the package's build script.
    *   Tool: `execute_command` (e.g., `npm run build` or `[full_path_to_npm] run build`).
    *   **Previous Attempt (2025-05-19 12:11:49 PM):** Failed.

        npm : The term 'npm' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a
        path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException
        ```
        **Issue:** `npm` command not found. Node.js/npm may not be installed or not in PATH. This blocks both `npm install` and `npm run build`.
    *   **Status:** Pending. Blocked by `npm` command not being found.


4.  **Verify `dist` Directory Creation**:
    *   Action: Check if the `dist` directory now exists within `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core`.
    *   Tool: `list_files` on `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core`.
    *   **Status:** Pending (Blocked by Step 2 & 3 failure).

5.  **Verify Main Build Artifacts**:
    *   Action: Check for the existence of `index.js` and `index.d.ts` (if applicable) in `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/dist/`.
    *   Tool: `list_files` on `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/dist/`.
    *   **Status:** Pending (Blocked by Step 2 & 3 failure).

6.  **Verify ESM Build Artifacts**:
    *   Action: Check for the existence of `index.js` in `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/dist/esm/`.
    *   Tool: `list_files` on `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/dist/esm/`.
    *   **Status:** Pending (Blocked by Step 2 & 3 failure).

7.  **Document Outcome**:
    *   Action: Record the success or failure of the build process, including any error messages and the list of created files/directories. Update this task document with the results.
    *   **Status:** In Progress.
