# Task: Create @pubmd/core Package Directories

**Parent:** `../../packages/core/implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md`
**Children:** None

## Objective
To create the necessary directory structure for the `@pubmd/core` package, specifically `packages/core/` and `packages/core/src/`.

## Context
- The `@pubmd/core` package is being initialized as part of the "Foundational Setup & Core Migration" (Week 1) plan.
- The parent `packages` directory is assumed to exist at `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/`.
- This task is a prerequisite for creating files within the `@pubmd/core` package.
- The `implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md` lists these directories as required.

## Steps
1.  **Verify Parent Directory**:
    *   Confirm the existence of the `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/` directory.
    *   If it does not exist, create it first: `mkdir Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages` (or use an equivalent file system operation tool).
2.  **Create `packages/core/` Directory**:
    *   Execute the command to create the main package directory: `mkdir Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core`.
    *   Verify successful creation.
3.  **Create `packages/core/src/` Directory**:
    *   Execute the command to create the source directory within the package: `mkdir Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/src`.
    *   Verify successful creation.
4.  **Consider `.gitkeep` (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   If the `packages/core/src/` directory will be empty initially (before `index.ts` is created), consider adding a `.gitkeep` file to ensure the directory is tracked by Git.
    *   Command: `touch Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/src/.gitkeep`

## Dependencies
- **Requires**:
    - Existence of `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/` directory (or its creation as part of this task).
    - Completion of strategic planning for directory structure as per `../../packages/core/implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md`.
- **Blocks**:
    - Creation of files within `packages/core/` and `packages/core/src/`, such as:
        - `Strategy_Task_CoreSetup_PackageJson_20250518_094140.md` (content definition for `package.json`)
        - `Strategy_Task_CoreSetup_TsConfig_20250518_094528.md` (content definition for `tsconfig.json`)
        - `Strategy_Task_CoreSetup_IndexTs_20250518_094656.md` (content definition for `index.ts`)
        - `Strategy_Task_CoreSetup_Readme_20250518_094841.md` (content definition for `README.md`)
        - (And their corresponding Execution tasks for file creation)

## Expected Output
- The following directories successfully created in the file system:
    - `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/`
    - `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/src/`
- Optionally, `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/src/.gitkeep` created.
