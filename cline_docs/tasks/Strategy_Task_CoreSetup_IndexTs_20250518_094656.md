# Task: Define Initial `packages/core/src/index.ts` Content

**Parent:** `../../packages/core/implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md`
**Children:** None

## Objective
To define the initial content for the `index.ts` file, which will serve as the main entry point for the `@pubmd/core` package. Initially, this file may be empty or contain placeholder exports.

## Context
- The `@pubmd/core` package is being set up.
- This `index.ts` file will be located at `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/src/index.ts`.
- The `implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md` specifies this as a necessary file for the initial package structure.
- The purpose of this file is to export the public API of the `@pubmd/core` package.

## Steps
1.  **Determine Initial Content Strategy**:
    *   Based on the `implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md`, the initial content can be minimal.
    *   Consider if any placeholder exports (e.g., a type or a simple function) are useful for early integration testing or if an empty file is sufficient for now. An empty file is acceptable if no immediate exports are planned before refactoring existing logic.
    *   A common practice is to include a simple comment indicating its purpose.
2.  **Draft `index.ts` Content**:
    *   If opting for an empty file with a comment:
        ```typescript
        // Main entry point for the @pubmd/core package
        // Exports will be added here as modules are developed/refactored.
        ```
    *   If opting for a placeholder export (example):
        ```typescript
        // Main entry point for the @pubmd/core package
        
        export type CorePlaceholder = string;
        
        export const coreInitMessage = (): string => {
          return "Core package initialized.";
        };
        ```
    *   For this initial setup, an empty file with a comment is likely sufficient as per the plan.
3.  **Finalize Content**:
    *   Ensure the content is valid TypeScript.
    *   Confirm it aligns with the minimal requirements of the initial package setup.

## Dependencies
- **Requires**:
    - Design decisions from `../../packages/core/implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md#3-high-level-approach--design-decisions`.
- **Blocks**:
    - Actual creation of the `packages/core/src/index.ts` file (Execution Task).

## Expected Output
- A string representing the complete and correct initial content for `packages/core/src/index.ts`.
