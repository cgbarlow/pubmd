# Task: Define Initial `packages/core/README.md` Content

**Parent:** `../../packages/core/implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md`
**Children:** None

## Objective
To define the initial content for the `README.md` file for the `@pubmd/core` package. This file will provide a basic overview of the package.

## Context
- The `@pubmd/core` package is being set up.
- This `README.md` file will be located at `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/packages/core/README.md`.
- The `implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md` specifies this as a necessary file for the initial package structure, requiring a basic placeholder.

## Steps
1.  **Determine Initial Content Requirements**:
    *   Refer to `implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md` which states a "Basic placeholder with package name and purpose."
2.  **Draft `README.md` Content**:
    *   Include a main heading with the package name (e.g., `# @pubmd/core`).
    *   Add a brief sentence or two describing the package's purpose (e.g., "Core library for the PubMD project, containing shared utilities, PDF generation logic, and data processing functions.").
    *   Consider adding placeholder sections for future content, such as:
        *   `## Installation`
        *   `## Usage`
        *   `## Contributing`
        *   `## License` (though the main project `LICENSE` might cover this).
    *   Example draft:
        ```markdown
        # @pubmd/core

        Core library for the PubMD project. This package will house shared utilities, PDF generation logic, data processing functions, and other core functionalities.

        ## Overview
        (To be filled in as development progresses)

        ## Installation
        (Details on how to install/use this package within the pnpm workspace or as a standalone, if applicable)

        ## Usage
        (Examples of how to use the exported modules and functions)

        ## Contributing
        (Guidelines for contributing to this package)

        ## License
        This package is part of the Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT project and is covered by its main license.
        ```
3.  **Finalize Content**:
    *   Ensure the Markdown is well-formed.
    *   Confirm it meets the "basic placeholder" requirement.

## Dependencies
- **Requires**:
    - Design decisions from `../../packages/core/implementation_plan_core_package_setup.md#3-high-level-approach--design-decisions`.
    - Package name: `@pubmd/core`.
- **Blocks**:
    - Actual creation of the `packages/core/README.md` file (Execution Task).

## Expected Output
- A string representing the complete and correct initial content for `packages/core/README.md`.
