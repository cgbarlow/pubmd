# Task: Define Verification Steps for `pnpm` Workspace

**Parent:** `documentation/03_Implementation/Implementation_Plan.md#week-1-foundational-setup--core-migration`
**Children:** None

## Objective
To define the specific steps required to verify that the existing `pnpm` workspace is correctly configured and operational for the project, and to identify any necessary refinements.

## Context
- The project already has a `package.json` specifying `pnpm` as the package manager, and a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file.
- The `pnpm-workspace.yaml` defines `packages/*` as the package location.
- This task is part of "Area: Project Setup" for "Week 1: Foundational Setup & Core Migration".
- The goal is not to initialize from scratch, but to ensure the existing setup is robust and ready.

## Steps
1.  **Review `package.json`**:
    *   Confirm `packageManager` field specifies a recent, stable `pnpm` version (e.g., `pnpm@10.6.4` or later).
    *   Note any existing root-level scripts relevant to workspace operations (e.g., `pnpm install`, build scripts).
2.  **Review `pnpm-workspace.yaml`**:
    *   Confirm it correctly lists `packages/*` or other intended package locations.
3.  **Define Verification Commands**:
    *   Specify the command to install dependencies across the workspace (e.g., `pnpm install`).
    *   Specify commands to check for workspace integrity or list workspace packages (e.g., `pnpm ls -r --depth -1`).
4.  **Define Success Criteria**:
    *   Successful execution of `pnpm install` without errors.
    *   Correct identification of (future) workspace packages by `pnpm`.
5.  **Identify Potential Refinements**:
    *   Consider if any standard pnpm configurations (e.g., via `.npmrc` for shared settings like `shamefully-hoist=true` if needed, or specific strictness settings) should be recommended or added.
    *   Determine if any root-level scripts in `package.json` need to be added or modified for common workspace tasks.
6.  **Document Findings and Recommendations**:
    *   Summarize the verification steps.
    *   List any recommended refinements to the `pnpm` setup.

## Dependencies
- Requires:
    - `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/package.json` (for review)
    - `Cline-Recursive-Chain-of-Thought-System-CRCT-/pnpm-workspace.yaml` (for review)
    - `documentation/03_Implementation/Implementation_Plan.md#week-1-foundational-setup--core-migration` (for overall context)
- Blocks: None directly, but successful verification is a prerequisite for package creation within the workspace.

## Expected Output
- A clear set of documented steps and criteria for verifying the `pnpm` workspace.
- A list of any recommended refinements to the existing `pnpm` configuration.
- This information will be used to guide the actual execution/verification of the pnpm setup.
